## NoDB Dungeon 

NoDB dungeon is a simple text dungeon crawl game using monsters from the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition API.

It was built as my first solo project at DevMountain. The name refers to this project not utilizing a database. The goal of the project was to build a RESTful API, query an external API, and build a front end in React.
